in comparison to the CAP theorem, BASE chooses availability over consistency

used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases
- **basically available** - the system guarantees availability
- **soft state** - the state of the system may change over time, even without input
- **eventual consistency** - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that period
