#### the approach is important!
- goals: scalable, reliable, and efficient 
1. understand the problem statement
	- clarify requirements - core requirements, constraints, and goals
	- define scope - establish what feature and functionalities are needed 
2. design the system at a high level
	- outline architecture - major components such as client, servers, databases, and APIs
	- choose technologies - select appropriate technologies and tools for each component based on scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance
3. dive into detailed design
	- component design - responsibilities and interactions of each component
	- data modeling - schema for databases, how data will be stored, accessed, and managed
	- APIs and interfaces - how communication happens (API endpoints, data formats, protocols)
4. consider scalability
	- load handling - load balancing, caching, sharding
	- vertical vs. horizontal scaling - scale up or scale out based on the needs
5. address scalability and fault tolerance
	- redundancy - ensure system availability in case of component failure (eg. replication, failover)
	- monitoring and alerts - respond to critical failures or performance degradations
6. discuss trade-offs
	- eg. consistency and availability, cost considerations
7. test and validate
	- simulate usage - describe methods for load testing and stress testing
	- validation - ensure that design meets all requirements and can handle real-world usage
8. clear communication
	- design explanation - articulate your design choices and rationale, use diagrams
	- seek feedback - engage with the interviewer, asking for feedback or clarification on any points of your design
